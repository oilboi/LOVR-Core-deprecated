 A blocky game engine written in LuaJIT for the LOVR engine.

 Built by modders, for modders.

If you'd like to discuss fixes/improvements to the engine here is the discord: https://discord.gg/T4mUaDG

This is stuck on 0.12 Mushroom Detector https://github.com/bjornbytes/lovr/releases/tag/v0.12.0 so if you'd like to try this out and you're not on windows please plop a version of it into there and you can run it :D
